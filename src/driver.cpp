		//
		// although there is a GLUE_IFACE.QueryGuestInfo information class that returns this
		// information, #IG_QUERY_INFO_CLASS_MAX_GPFN, in practice is has been observed to not
		// always be accurate. Especially on XEN, for example, for guests with 1G of memory it
		// would usually report back 4G of memory available, or for guests with more memory, the
		// value would be slightly below the last page the guest could actually access. Since
		// having this information is vital for some subsystems (such as the \#VE one), we try to
		// figure it out ourselves. The algorithm is simple enough. Start with the page returned
		// by #IG_QUERY_INFO_CLASS_MAX_GPFN query, and try to see if there is any memory available
		// about it. If a physical page is mappable, we consider that it is available to the guest,
		// since introcore should not be able to access memory that is not available to the guest.
		// We do this search until a hole of 256 consecutive invalid pages is found. If during this
		// search a valid page is found above the one returned by the hypervisor, we consider it to
		// be the last physical page which the guest can access. If no page is found about the hint
		// value, we may be in the case in which the hypervisor reported more than the guest has
		// access to. While this is not as critical as the case in which the value is lower, it may
		// still lead to unnecessary memory consumption. In this case we go below the page returned
		// by the hypervisor until we find a page that we can map. The first page that can be
		// mapped is treated as the last physical page the guest can access. Since this value will
		// not change while introcore is running, it is cached inside the #gGuest variable and
		// subsequent calls to this function will return the cached value, in order to avoid long
		// pauses every time the query is done.
